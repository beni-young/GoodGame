## Good Game - A Social Gaming Meetup App

Good Game is a social media platform built around connecting our users with other people in their local area who share similar interests in gaming.
## About   
A mobile app that can be the first place for people to build or get involved in their local gaming scenes such as taking some of the work and intimidation out of doing things like starting a Dungeons & 
Dragons group in your area, joining in on local board game nights, or participating in a nearby fighting game tournament. 

Whether you're looking to meet new people, learn new games, find groups to play with, or get out of your comfort zone, Good Game can assist. 

## Features
* letting users create accounts/profiles where they can specify their local area (using city or zip code)
* identify games or genre of games that they want to find locals to play with (including both video games and tabletop games)
* provide tools to connect with those users: giving options to start local groups, ‚Äúput out a call‚Äù to gather players for a particular group, or to join existing groups of players.
* players may enter a group chat where they can socialize and coordinate meeting up and playing games.
* allowing users and venues to post gaming events
* providing information on what games and events are popular in your area
